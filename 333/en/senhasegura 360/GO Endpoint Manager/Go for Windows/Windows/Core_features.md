GO Endpoint Manager for Windows is a Privilege Elevation and Delegation Management (PEDM) tool for MicrosoftÂ Windows.

Our tool is fully integrated with the broader senhasegura platform to allow end users to run applications requiring administrative privileges without gaining access to the privileged credential. It also performs routine {{glossary.Password}} rotations with no human intervention required. Administrators can group and audit all user activity for better governance and decision\-making.
