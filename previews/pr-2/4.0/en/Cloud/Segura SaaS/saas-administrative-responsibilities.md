# Administrative responsibilities

This section outlines the division of responsibilities between customers and Segura concerning the management and operation of the SaaS environment.

## **Customer responsibilities**

### **Access management**

* **User identity control**: customers are responsible for controlling access by managing user identities, including configuring policies, groups, and permissions.  
* **User deactivation**: prompt deactivation of users who no longer require access to the application is crucial to maintaining security and compliance.

### **Network and security**

* **Network configuration**: customers must set up network configurations to enable seamless user access to the application.  
* **Security policies**: customers are accountable for maintaining robust security policies within their environment and designating focal points for communication with the Segura Support team.

### **Deployment**

* **Initial setup**: customers are responsible for the initial setup of primary vault entities.  
* **Connectivity assurance**: ensuring connectivity between the vault and target devices falls under the customer's domain. Custom support services for deployment can be contracted separately if needed.

## **Segura's responsibilities**

### **Operation**

* **Snapshots and updates**: Segura is responsible for performing system snapshots, conducting updates, and restoring services in case of unavailability.

### **Monitoring**

* **Environmental health**: ensuring the environment's overall health is a key responsibility of Segura.  
* **Customer monitoring**: customers are tasked with monitoring user behavior, auditable events, and security policy compliance. Customers may also configure SIEM/Syslog to receive security events.

### **Backup**

* **Data backup**: Segura is responsible for backing up client environments through system snapshots to ensure data integrity and availability.

### **High availability**

* **Provision and restoration**: Segura handles the provisioning of the environment, facilitates restorations, and oversees product updates. The high availability guarantee encompasses the Segura connection side exclusively.

By clearly delineating these responsibilities, both Segura and its customers can ensure a secure, efficient, and well-managed SaaS environment, facilitating effective identity protection and management.
