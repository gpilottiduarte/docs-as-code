# Segura SaaS

## **What is Segura SaaS?**

Segura SaaS is a service model that removes the need for on-site installations, resulting in cost savings and reduced administrative tasks. It eliminates the requirement for maintaining and updating software or hardware, allowing organizations to concentrate on their core operations without worrying about infrastructure management.

## **Comparison between On-Premise and SaaS Models**

The On-Premise model involves the local installation of software on the company's servers, providing complete control over the infrastructure but requiring significant upfront investments, manual updates, and presenting challenges in scalability. Additionally, the responsibility for security and maintenance falls on the organization itself. In contrast, the SaaS (Software as a Service) model offers software accessible via the internet, with infrastructure and updates managed by the provider, allowing for easy scalability and subscription-based costs.

## **Advantages of Segura SaaS**

* **Simplified Infrastructure Management:** Clients are relieved from managing physical infrastructure, as Segura handles maintenance, updates, and backups.  
* **Cost Efficiency:** The model reduces capital and operational expenses by removing the need for hardware investments and lessening administrative burdens. The SaaS subscription model, with its predictable monthly or annual fees, simplifies budget planning for businesses.
* **Automatic Updates:** Clients receive the latest features and security enhancements without manual interventions.  
* **Secure Backups:** Data is securely backed up, protecting against loss.  
* **Accessibility:** Provides easy accessibility and scalability. Users can access software anytime, anywhere with internet, enabling remote work and mobility.  
* **Scalability:** Is straightforward and efficient, allowing you to adjust the number of users or resources as needed.
