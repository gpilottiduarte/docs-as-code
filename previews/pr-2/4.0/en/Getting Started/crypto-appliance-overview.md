# Crypto Appliance

To establish remote connections, Segura uses Dell's *iDRAC* technology.

## What is iDRAC?
**Integrated Dell Remote Access Controller (iDRAC)** is a hardware and software management tool for remote access, system recovery, and power saving in PowerEdge servers.

iDRAC is a controller card embedded in the motherboard that allows you to monitor any operating system remotely.

After setting up the network correctly, the admin user can access this system through its IP address using a web browser, Telnet, or SSH connection.

## Other physical appliances
Segura exclusively offers support for the Segura Crypto Appliance and doesn't provide assistance for other physical appliances.
