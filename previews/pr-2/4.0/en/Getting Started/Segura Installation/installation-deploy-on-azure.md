# Deploy on Azure

In this article, you’ll find two options for deploying Segura on **Microsoft Azure**.

## Option 1: Use a public image
:::(error) (Important)
This option is only available if there is a match between the publicly available image and the user's location.
:::

Currently, public images are available for the following regions:

* Brazil South
* East US
* France Central
* UAE North
* West Europe

For detailed instructions on how to deploy using a public image, refer to the tutorial [How to deploy on Azure using a public image](/v4/docs/installation-how-to-deploy-on-azure-using-a-public-image).



## Option 2: Manually upload the application image
If there is no suitable public image available for your location, you’ll need to manually upload the application image. Please refer to the article [How to deploy on Azure by manually uploading the application image](/v4/docs/installation-how-to-deploy-on-azure-by-manually-uploading-the-application-image) for detailed instructions on accomplishing this task.
