# App Primary Failover

The **App Primary Failover** is a feature designed to enhance the reliability of cluster architectures with three or more members.

This is an optional feature to automatically ensure the presence of a single designated instance serving as the primary in your cluster environment.

:::(error) (Important)
When you enable **App Primary Failover**, administrators can't manually choose the primary instance. The feature takes care of this automatically to ensure high availability in the cluster.
