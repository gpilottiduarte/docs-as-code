:::(Warning) (Attention)
From the Segura 3.26 version, you have a new password manager product called **MySafe**. You can quickly and easily add and share passwords, files, and notes with other users. Learn more about [MySafe](https://portal.document360.io/v3-33/docs/mysafe).

The Protected Information will only receive updates for bug fixes that may have security issues.  

In addition, users will only be able to add shared information. They will not have the option to add personal information. If you need to add personal information, use the **MySafe** product.

We recommend that you migrate your passwords, files, and notes to the **MySafe** product to ensure access to new features and improvements.
