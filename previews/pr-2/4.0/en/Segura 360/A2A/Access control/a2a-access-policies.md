# Access policies

:::(warning) (Attention) 

The **Access policies** report has been discontinued. Although it’s still available in the system, it doesn’t reflect the configured permissions and will be removed in future versions.   
::: 

Access permissions in the **A2A** module are configured and managed directly in the **Authorizations** menu.  

More information in [About applications and authorizations in A2A](/v4/docs/a2a-about-applications-and-authorizations) and [How to manage authorizations in A2A](/v4/docs/how-to-manage-authorizations-in-a2a).
