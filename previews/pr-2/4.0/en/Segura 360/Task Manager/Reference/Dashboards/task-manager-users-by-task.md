# Users by task

This document provides information about the **Users by task** report screen in **Task Manager** that displays a detailed overview of all tasks and users authorized to execute them. Through it, you can view:

* Which users have access to which tasks.  
* In which environments and systems each task can be executed.  
* Which tasks require approval or justification.

The report is a strategic IT governance tool that enables:

* Quick identification of possible security gaps.  
* Fast and objective permission auditing.  
* Ensuring the principle of least privilege is always respected.

## Prerequisites

## Path to access
