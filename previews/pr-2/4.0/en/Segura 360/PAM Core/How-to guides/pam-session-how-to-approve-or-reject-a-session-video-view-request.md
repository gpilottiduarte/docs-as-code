## Register an approver

1. On Segura, in the navigation bar, hover over the **Products menu** and select **Settings**.
2. In the side menu, choose **Access control** > **Manage Approvers**.
3. On the actions menu click **Add**
4. On the **Approvers** screen fill in the fields:
    1. In **Module**, select the PAM module that the approving user will have access to.
    2. Click **Add** and in the list select the approving users you want to register.
6. Click **Save**.

## Approve a request
For the approval to view session videos in the Segura system, access  **Settings** > **System Parameters** > **Global** > **Approval Workflow**, on the option **Enable approval for session videos?*** set as **Yes**.

1. On Segura, in the navigation bar, hover over the **Products menu** and select **PAM Core**.
2. On the side menu, select **Audit** > **Session record requests** > **My session video appovals**.
3. In the list, choose the session you want, and in the **Actions** column, click on **Actions button** and select **Approve**.
4. In the confirmation box, click **Yes** to perform the action.

The system will display an approval confirmation message. Now, the user will have access to view the video.

## Reject a request

1. On Segura, in the navigation bar, hover over the **Products menu** and select **PAM Core**.
2. In the side menu, select **Audit** > **Session record requests** > **My session video appovals**.
3. In the list, choose the session you want, and in the **Actions** column, click on **Actions button** and select **Reject**.
4. In the confirmation box, click **Yes** to perform the action.

A reject confirmation message will be displayed by the system. Now, the user wonâ€™t have access to view the video. However, a new request screen will be displayed, allowing you to request the video viewing again.

These two actions can also be performed via the **Request details**, accessed through the column **Actions**. To do that, click on **Actions button**. In the screen that opens, choose between the options **Approve request** or **Disapprove request**.
