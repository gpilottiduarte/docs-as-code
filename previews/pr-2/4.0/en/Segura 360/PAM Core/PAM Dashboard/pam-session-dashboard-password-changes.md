# Password changes

This document provides information about the **Password changes** dashboard screen, which brings information on password changes carried out on Segura.

:::(info) (**Info**)  
The dashboard can only be accessed by users who have administrator or system auditor permissions.  
:::

The credential quantities and their status are presented considering the following rules:

* Child credentials will only be considered on this dashboard if their respective parent credentials have the automatic change active. In some cases, the system doesnâ€™t schedule a specific change for the child credential, creating and executing the change at the time of the parent credential change.  
* The "Waiting" and "Error" will not necessarily display the sum of "Updated" and "Expired," as they depend on each change's behavior.

## Path to access

1. On Segura, in the navigation bar, hover over the **Products menu** and select **PAM Core**.  
2. In the side menu, select **Dashboard \> Password changes**.
