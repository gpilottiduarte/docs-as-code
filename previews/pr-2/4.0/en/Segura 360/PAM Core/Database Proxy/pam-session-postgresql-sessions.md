:::(warning) (**Attention**)  
When using Database Proxy with PostgreSQL, when authorized IPs to authenticate to the PostgreSQL database server are restricted, itâ€™s necessary to change the PostgreSQL `pg_hba.conf` file. This file contains the list of IPs that need to be authorized and **must** contain the senhasegura IPs.
