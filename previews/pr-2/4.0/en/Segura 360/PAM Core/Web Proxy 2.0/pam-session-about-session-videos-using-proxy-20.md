When viewing a session's video recording, the timeline will show the moments when there were the most interactions, represented by screen activity or keyboard activity.

Besides these interactions being visible on the timeline, it's also possible to access these moments in the video's keystroke log, which lists the minutes and which interaction took place at that moment. By clicking on the chosen time, the video is taken directly to that moment.

All audio, whether input or output, will be captured by the session. This new function allows all audio spoken by the user or listened to to be available during Live Stream viewing or later accessed by recording the session. However, it will only be available for sessions via Web Proxy RDP.

::: (error) (**Important**)  
Due to the recording of video and audio sessions, it's essential for the client to obtain explicit consent from the employees for these recordings. Additionally, it's mandatory to inform the employees at the beginning of each session that it will be recorded, including both audio and video. Proper configuration of the banner message is crucial to ensure that all participants are adequately informed and aligned with privacy policies and compliance requirements.
