# PAM Core

## What is PAM?

**Privileged Access Management (PAM**) is a cybersecurity strategy focusing on controlling and securing accounts with elevated access in IT environments. These accounts have special permissions that, if compromised, could cause severe damage to an organization.

## Why is PAM important?

Cyber attacks frequently target privileged accounts, giving attackers unrestricted access to confidential data and critical systems. The Segura PAM solution helps mitigate these risks by:

* **Strict access control**: Segura PAM solution determines who has access to accounts, when, and for what purpose.
* **Monitoring and auditing**: account activities are monitored and logged to detect suspicious behavior.
* **Credential protection**: credentials are stored securely and encrypted.
* **Proxy access**: allows monitored access to accounts via Segura, recording all user actions for later auditing.
* **Command control**: allows specific commands to be blocked during proxy access, preventing harmful actions from being carried out.

## Benefits of PAM:

* **Reduced risk of attacks**: making unauthorized access to privileged accounts more difficult, reducing the risk of data breaches.
* **Improved compliance**: facilitates compliance with regulations requiring the protection of confidential data.
* **Increased operational efficiency:** automates the management of privileged accounts, freeing up time for administrators to focus on other tasks.

## PAM components:

* **Just-in-time (JIT) access management:** privileged access is granted only when necessary and for a limited period.
* **Session management:** sessions are monitored and recorded for auditing.
* **Credential management:** credentials are stored securely and encrypted.
