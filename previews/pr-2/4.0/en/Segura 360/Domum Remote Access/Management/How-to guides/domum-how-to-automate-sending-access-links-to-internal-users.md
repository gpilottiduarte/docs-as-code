# How to automate sending access links to internal users

**Domum Remote Access** offers the option to automate sending access links to internal users after adding them to a group. The feature works for manual addition and provisioning via SCIM or AD. This article provides the steps for this task.

:::(Warning) (Attention)
If the user is inactivated or removed from the group, the system blocks access through the link.
