# How to configure the logo in Segura

You can customize Segura to display a logo according to your preferences. It's possible to configure a logo for both the internal pages of the application (**Desktop logo**) and the login page (**Login screen logo**).

## Configure the logo

1. On Segura, in the navigation bar, hover over the **Products menu** and select **Settings**.
2. In the side menu, select **Customization > Logo**.  
3. On the **Application Logo** page, you have two options:  
   1. **Desktop logo (PNG file, maximum height: 35px)**: this is the logo that will be used internally in Segura and will be visible at the top of your instance.  
   2. **Login screen logo (PNG file, recommended height: 100px)**: this is the logo that will be displayed on the login screen of your Segura instance.  
4. To upload the image, click on the **Choose file** button (**note:** the text will change according to your browser's language) and select the image file in `.png` format that will be used. Do this for both images.  
5. Click on **Save**.
