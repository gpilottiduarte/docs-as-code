# How to configure password change failure notifications

It's possible to schedule the sending of an email for reports in case of password change failures. By default, this option is disabled. To enable it, follow these instructions:

1. [Register a new notification](/v4/docs/notification-how-to-manage-notifications) by choosing the **Daily Password Summary** option when registering the notification.  
2. On Segura, in the navigation bar, hover over the **Products menu** and select **Settings**.
3. On the side menu, select **System parameters > Global > Notifications**.
4. In the **Daily passwords changes failures notification** section, check the option **Change default notification delivery time**.  
6. In the **When to notify** dropdown menu, select a time.  
7. Click **Save**.

You can enter times other than those pre-defined in the selection boxes. To do this, select the selection box and type a valid hour value. The system only accepts valid times; if an invalid value is entered, an error message will be displayed on the screen.
