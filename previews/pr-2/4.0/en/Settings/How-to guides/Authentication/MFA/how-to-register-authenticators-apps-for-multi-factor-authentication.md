You may opt to utilize an external authenticator application, such as Authy or Google Authenticator. In this scenario, follow these implementation steps:

1. Upon selecting the **Authenticator Apps** option, you will be directed to the **Authenticator Apps** screen, which displays a QR Code and an authentication code.

2. Launch your selected authenticator application and proceed with the application's instructions for either scanning the QR Code or manually entering the authentication code.

4. Select **Validate** to complete the registration process.

A success message will confirm the successful completion of the process. During your next login attempt, youâ€™ll be prompted to provide an authentication token after entering your access credentials.
