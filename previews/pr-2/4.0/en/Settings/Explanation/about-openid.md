# About OpenID

OpenID is a decentralized authentication standard that allows users to authenticate themselves on various websites and online services using a single digital identity, without the need to create and manage multiple passwords. The aim of OpenID is to simplify the login process for users, while increasing security and privacy.

When a user tries to access a website or service that supports OpenID, they are redirected to the OpenID provider of their choice, where they log in once. The OpenID provider then confirms the user's identity to the requesting site or service, allowing the user to access the resource without having to create a new account or password.

OpenID supports various authentication methods, including traditional passwords, two-factor authentication and digital certificates. This allows users to choose the level of security that best suits their needs.
