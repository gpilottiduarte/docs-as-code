# MySafe

**MySafe APIs** were developed to provide programmatic access and management of personal and team corporate data stored in **MySafe**, ensuring the maintenance of information integrity and confidentiality. Operating as a REST-based solution, they offer integration features with third-party applications for querying, creating, updating, activating, and deactivating passwords, notes, and API secrets.


## Features



**MySafe APIs** functionalities include:


* **Password management**: access one or a list of saved passwords; create, update, activate, and deactivate passwords created by you or shared with your user.

* **Note management**: access one or a list of saved notes; create, update, activate, and deactivate a note created by you or shared with your user.

* **API secret management**: access one or a list of saved API secrets; create, update, activate, and deactivate an API secret created by you or shared with your user.

## Applicabilities

**MySafe APIs** serve as a bridge for integration with third-party applications, enabling developers to programmatically access items stored within **MySafe**. The main function of these APIs is to facilitate this access and ensure all the benefits that **MySafe** provides. These benefits include:

### Protection against data leaks

 **MySafe** is crucial in safeguarding passwords, notes, and API secrets, as well as preventing leaks of sensitive information. By adopting this solution, organizations can strengthen their defenses against cyber threats and ensure the confidentiality of critical data.

### Secure team collaboration
Beyond secure storage, **MySafe** provides a safe way to share data among team members. This promotes efficient collaboration while maintaining control over who has access to specific information.

### Management of access to privileged information
 **MySafe** offers advanced features to control and manage access to privileged information. This functionality ensures that only authorized users can access confidential data, reinforcing the organization's security policies.

## Use case

In a consulting firm, a meeting note-taking AI is integrated with the API, allowing automatic note submission to the vault, where they are securely stored and shared with the involved participants for consultation. The API also allows another system to keep access to passwords, API secrets, and notes updated in real-time through integration. This ensures that, for example, if an employee is moved to another area, their access is automatically adjusted.
