# How to manage notifications

senhasegura enables the sending of reports via email, as well as scheduling them. This allows you to schedule the sending of, for example, the remote sessions report to certain users. These users will receive the reports when these notifications are sent, thus always staying updated about new remote sessions conducted during the period.

## Requirements

* To use the SMS notification sending option, it's necessary to have the Zenvia integration properly configured.  
  * SMS notifications wonâ€™t be sent without this configuration. To learn how to configure the Zenvia integration, access the SMS Service Integration document.  
* For email notifications, ensure that a default email is correctly configured.  
* You can find more information on how to integrate the Zenvia service with senhasegura by accessing the document [Integration with SMS service](/v3-33/docs/integration-with-sms-service).
