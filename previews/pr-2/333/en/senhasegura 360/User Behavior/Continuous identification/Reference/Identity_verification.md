# Identity verification

In this document, youâ€™ll find all the information about the re-authentication screens that allow users to verify their identity in senhasegura after performing actions considered suspicious.

## Re-authentication methods

The re-authentication methods depend on prior configuration. The available options are:

- **senhasegura vault password**
- **Microsoft Active Directory (AD) password**
- **TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) token**
- **Radius authentication**
- **Duo Security authentication**

In addition to re-authentication with the senhasegura user password, you can configure a multi-factor authentication code. In this case, when re-authentication is required, identity verification may randomly switch between the options registered in the account. For example, a user who has set up a TOTP token may be asked to reauthenticate using either the senhasegura user password or the TOTP.

:::(error) (Important!)
In the event of a reauthentication prompt, the application screen will be locked, and the user will not be able to continue using senhasegura without successful identity verification.
