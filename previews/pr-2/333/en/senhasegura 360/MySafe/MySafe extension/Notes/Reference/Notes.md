# Notes

On the **MySafe extension**'s home screen, within the **Notes** section, you'll find a list of notes stored in **MySafe**. These notes were either added by the user or shared with their account by another **MySafe** user. Each note is represented by its own card. By default, the cards are displayed in a compact format. However, clicking on the note’s name reveals an expanded card, providing more detailed information about the note.
