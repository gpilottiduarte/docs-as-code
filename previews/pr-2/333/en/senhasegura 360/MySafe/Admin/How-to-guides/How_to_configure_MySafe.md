## Configure MySafe
To configure **MySafe**, follow the steps below:

1. In the **Email configuration** section, fill in:
    1. **Sending account**: choose the email that will send the authentication code so that users can connect MySafe to the extension, mobile app, or access a temporarily shared item.

2. In the **External share** section, fill in:
    1. **Enable external share?***: define if users will be able to share items with people outside of **MySafe**. Available options are **Yes** and **No**.
    2. **Max. sharing time**: define the time limit that an item will be available for access by an external **MySafe** user. Use the first field to enter a number and the second field to enter the period. The available options are *Minutes*, *Hours*, *Days*, and *Months*.
    3. **Base URL**: enter the URL of the **MySafe** vault that will connect to the extension, mobile app, or the temporarily shared item.

:::(warning) (Attention)
* If the application is communicating with a **MySafe** vault in a multi-tenant scenario, the administrator must enter the tenant URL without `https://`.  
**Example**: `test.mt4.dev`  
<br>
* If this field isnâ€™t filled in, operations involving the **MySafe extension**, the **MySafe** section of the **senhasegura** mobile app, and **External** sharing will result in errors.
