# About User Groups

Using user groups in a Privileged Access Management (PAM) platform offers several strategic advantages, particularly in terms of security and governance.

By grouping users with similar access needs, Segura simplifies and strengthens the management of credentials and privileged access. This organization helps in the rapid implementation of security policies and effective monitoring of user activities, thus reducing the risk of unauthorized access or leakage of sensitive information since access becomes restricted and each user has access only to the resources that are strictly necessary for the group to which they belong.

Furthermore, user groups facilitate the conduct of audits and access reviews, ensuring that companies remain compliant with internal and external regulations. This provides an additional layer of security and control that is vital for organizational integrity and reputation.
