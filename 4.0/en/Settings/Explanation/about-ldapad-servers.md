# About LDAP/AD servers

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) and AD (Active Directory) servers are directory management systems used to organize and provide access to information on a network. They are essential for managing users, groups, permissions, and other related data in corporate environments. Although AD is a Microsoft-specific implementation that uses LDAP as one of its communication protocols, the two are often discussed together due to their common use in network environments.

## LDAP

LDAP is an open, standard protocol to access and manage directory services. It is designed to work on TCP/IP networks and provides a means of querying and modifying items in a directory of services, which is a hierarchical way of storing information about resources and users on a network. LDAP servers are used in various applications, such as authentication systems, address books, and network configurations.

## AD

Microsoft's Active Directory implements directory services for Windows-based network environments. It provides various identity and access management features, including user management, groups, security policies, and authentication. AD uses LDAP as one of its communication protocols to allow clients to access and manage information in the directory.

AD is more than just a directory service; it is an integrated solution that includes Domain Services, Federation Services, Certificate Services, and much more. It is a fundamental part of many organizations' infrastructure, as it offers an efficient way of managing security and access in complex network environments.

This makes them essential in modern networks, providing a centralized structure for storing and managing directory information.
