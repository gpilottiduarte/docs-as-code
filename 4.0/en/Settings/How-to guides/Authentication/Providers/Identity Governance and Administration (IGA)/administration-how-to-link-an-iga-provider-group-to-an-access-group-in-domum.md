### Requirements

* [Access group previously configured in **Domum**](/v4/docs/domum-create-access-group-for-vendor).

* * *

:::(Warning) (Caution)
If a user is in more than one vendor's register, the system will place this user in the last group found during synchronization.
:::

1. On Segura, in the navigation bar, hover over the **Products menu** and select **Domum**.
2. In the side menu, select **Settings > Vendors**.
4. Locate the **Vendor** referring to the [group you activated on the IGA access provider](/v4/docs/administration-how-to-create-a-scim-application-with-okta) from the list.
5. In the **Action** column, click the icon **Edit**. 
6. In the update window, fill in the **Registration** tab:
    1. **Vendor***: the system automatically completes the field.
    2. **Access group***: select one [group previously registered in Domum](/v4/docs/domum-create-access-group-for-vendor).
    3. **Start date***: select a date.
    4. **Status***: check **Enabled**.
7. Click **Save**.

A pop-up window displays a confirmation message indicating the completion of the process. You can use your application to perform various identity management operations, such as creating, updating, and deleting users. Your IGA provider will synchronize these changes with the application youâ€™ve made.
