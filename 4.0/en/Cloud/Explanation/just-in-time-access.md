# Just-In-Time Access

JIT, also known as just-in-time access, is a cybersecurity practice where the privilege granted to access applications or systems is limited to predetermined periods of time, on an as-needed basis. Once the predetermined time expires, users lose access to these resources. This helps to minimize the risk of standing privileges that attackers or malicious insiders can readily exploit.

**Cloud Entitlements** provides Temporary elevation, which is a JIT access type that raises privileges on a by-request basis. It gives more permissions to a user account for a limited time when requested. When the time is up, the additionally granted privileges are revoked, and the user returns to the standard permissions. 

## Benefits
### Enforces PoLP
JIT access implements the principle of least privilege (PoLP), granting users access only when necessary and for the least amount of time. 

### Regulatory compliance
JIT access leads to enhanced compliance and auditing capabilities. By implementing time-limited and on-demand access controls, organizations can ensure that access privileges are granted only when required.

### Reduces cyber risk
JIT access minimizes the attack surface through time-limited and on-demand access privileges. This proactive approach effectively mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and potential exploitation by cyber attackers. It also strengthens your organization's security posture by significantly reducing threats posed by standing privileges. Malicious users often target privileged accounts, creating potential security risks. However, with JIT access, privileged accounts are promptly disabled once a user completes their task, expiring the privileges and enhancing overall security.
