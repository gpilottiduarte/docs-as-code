# Access reasons

The **Access reasons** in **Task Manager** are the layer that adds context and transparency to each execution request.  
This document provides information about the **Access reasons** report screen, which enables administrators to:

* Define standardized reasons for task execution.  
* Create a transparent record of access justifications.  
* Improve audit and traceability of actions.
  
::: (warning) (Attention)  
The search field and **Type** column donâ€™t reflect current settings, since all **Task Manager** access reasons are of type **Task execution**.
