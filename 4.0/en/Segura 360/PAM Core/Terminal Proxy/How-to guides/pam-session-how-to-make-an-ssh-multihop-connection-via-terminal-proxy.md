# How to make an SSH Multihop connection via Terminal Proxy

This document provides information about a step-by-step guide on how to make an SSH connection with Multihop via Terminal Proxy.

This type of access is used to facilitate access to the target device in applications that don’t provide interactive prompts and to perform access by skipping the Segura shell step. Multihop serves to connect directly to the destination without the need to perform additional steps.

## Requirements

* Have a command prompt-type application installed.

---
## Access using multihop
Use the following syntax depending on the desired access, replacing the strings with the values ​​described in the table below:
**String**|**Description**
|---|---|
`senhasegura_user`|User of the Segura vault.
`senhasegura_vault`|Hostname or IP address of the Segura vault.
`credential`|User’s credential you want to use for access.
`target_device`|Hostname or IP address of the device you want to access.
`domain`|Domain name associated with the device or credential.
`mfa_token`|Code generated by MFA Token.

:::(warning) (**Attention**)
When your password is reset or expires, the terminal will display a message warning that the password needs to be changed and display the steps that the user must take to register a new password through the web interface.
:::

#### Standard connection only with the user and the Segura server:
`ssh senhasegura_user@senhasegura_vault`

#### Multihop connection containing the user and the destination server:
In this example, Segura will connect directly to the target server without handing over the intermediate endpoint. The credential and target device are in square brackets
`ssh senhasegura_user[credential@target_device]@senhasegura_vault`

To access the device or when a key and a credential have the same name, using the SSH key, making multihop connections.

`ssh senhasegura_user[key\credential@target_device]@senhasegura_vault`

:::(warning) (**Attention**)
When accessing another device with an SSH key, always use the word `key\`.
:::

#### Multihop connection using domain credentials:
`ssh senhasegura_user[domain\credential@target_device]@senhasegura_vault`

:::(info) (**Info**)

:::

#### Multihop connection containing the OTP token:
`ssh senhasegura_user[credential@target_device]mfa_token@senhasegura_vault`
