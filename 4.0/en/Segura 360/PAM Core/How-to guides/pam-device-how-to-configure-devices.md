# How to configure device categories

The Segura platform allows you to register different types of devices from different manufacturers, each with its own specialty and use. This type of registration makes it easier to identify your devices, since you can organize them into categories.

In addition to the list of devices offered by Segura, it’s also possible to create new types of devices to meet your business needs.
