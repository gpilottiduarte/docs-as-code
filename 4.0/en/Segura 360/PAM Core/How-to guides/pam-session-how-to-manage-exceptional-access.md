## Manage an exceptional access

1. On Segura, in the navigation bar, hover over the **Products menu** and select **PAM Core**.
2. In the side menu, select **Audit > Sessions > Exceptional Access**.
3. In the report list, select the record and, in the **Actions** column, click the **Actions button** and choose the desired operation:
    1. **Details**, opens the screen with detailed information about the access.
    2. **Edit**, opens the **Exceptional Access** screen with the access details and fields for **Start** and **End** to edit the access restriction period. This option is displayed only when the request has not yet been approved.
    3. **Revoke**, revokes an already approved exceptional access. Only the approver/admin can revoke approved exceptional accesses.
