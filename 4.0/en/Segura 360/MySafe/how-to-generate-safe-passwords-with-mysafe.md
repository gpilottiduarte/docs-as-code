# How to genereate safe passwords with MySafe

The security of your accounts directly depends on the strength of your passwords. To help you create safe and unique passwords easily and efficiently, **MySafe** offers an integrated automatic password generator.

This document provides a step-by-step guide for using the **MySafe** password generator to create safe passwords in the web version, browser extension, and the Segura mobile app.

## What is a safe password? 

Safe passwords must be unique and hard to guess. Using the same password across multiple accounts, such as your email, social media, and bank accounts, even if it's a complex password, poses a significant risk. If any of these services are compromised, an attacker could access all your accounts using that same password.

Therefore, a safe password is:

* **Long:** at least 12 characters.  
* **Complex:** contains uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.  
* **Unique:** each account has a different password.  
* **Random:** contains words or patterns that are difficult to guess.
