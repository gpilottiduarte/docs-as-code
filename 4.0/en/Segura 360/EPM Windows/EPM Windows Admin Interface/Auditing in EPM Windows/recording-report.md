# Recording report

## **Recording report**

When a user elevates an application, EPM will record a video while the application is running. As soon as the execution is finished, the video is forwarded to the Segura server, making it available for evaluation.

Caution

Through the **Session Video** record action, you can watch the video. However, this functionality will only be available if the **Enable session recording** parameter is active.

To view a recorded session: 

1. Access the Segura platform.   
2. Access the menu **PAM Core ➔ Access control ➔ Remote sessions.**   
3. In the **Proxy** field, filter by **EPM.**  
4. Click the **Action** play button to view the recording.

Info

Videos only appear after the service restarts and finish uploading videos. This process takes 15 minutes.
