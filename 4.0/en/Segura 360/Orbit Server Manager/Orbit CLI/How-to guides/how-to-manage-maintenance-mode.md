# How to manage maintenance mode

The **Orbit CLI** maintenance mode allows the system to stop processing the tasks generated by the application's automatic schedules while still processing the tasks added directly to the NATS queue.

## Help parameter

The maintenance mode help can be accessed using the `sudo orbit app maintenance -h` command, which returns the available parameters.

```shell
$ sudo orbit app maintenance -h

Usage: orbit app maintenance <command>

Application maintenance mode control

Commands:
 app maintenance enable     Enable maintenance mode
 app maintenance disable    Disable maintenance mode

Flags:
 -h, --help    Show context-sensitive help.
```

## Enabling maintenance mode

To enable maintenance mode, execute the following command:

```shell
sudo orbit app maintenance enable
```

This will put the application into maintenance mode, preventing it from processing the tasks generated by the automatic schedules.

## Disable maintenance mode

To disable maintenance mode and return the application to normal operation, run the following command:

```shell
sudo orbit app maintenance disable
```

## Check maintenance mode status

The application's status can be checked using the `sudo orbit app status` command, which includes a `Maintenance` field to indicate whether maintenance mode is active.

```shell
$ sudo orbit app status 
Application: Active 
Replication: Inactive 
Instance: Primary 
Maintenance: Yes 
Main: Yes
```
