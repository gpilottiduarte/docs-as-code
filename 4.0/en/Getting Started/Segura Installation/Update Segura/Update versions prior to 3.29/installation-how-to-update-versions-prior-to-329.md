# How to update online versions prior to 3.29

Customers with versions prior to 3.29 of Segura who wish to update to version 3.29 or later must follow the instructions provided in this article.

## Requirements


* Your [firewall rules](/v4/docs/installation-firewall-rules) must allow communication with Segura repositories.
* Set the correct server time.
* The Arbitrator must be removed from the cluster (only for environments with an Arbitrator).
* Take a snapshot before the update.

:::(Warning) (Application unavailable during update)
When Segura initiates the update process, it will be unavailable until the activity is complete.

## Take a snapshot

Snapshots should be taken only when Segura instances are offline. This ensures the ability to revert to a previous version if necessary.

1. You can shut down a Segura instance using the following command:
```Shell
sudo orbit shutdown
```
2. Once the instance is completely shut down, take a snapshot in the hypervisor. 
3. Reboot your Segura instance and update the application.
