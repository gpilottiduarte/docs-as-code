# How to update Segura on a very old version

Segura runs under the Linux operating system. With each new version of the operating system, Segura receives updates. If you are using a very old version and need to update to the newest version, you will need to perform the update process more than once, until you reach the newest version. 

## Update sequence
If you are using version 3.13 of Segura, you should update following this sequence of versions:

- 3.13 to 3.14.
- 3.14 to 3.28.
- 3.28 to 3.32.
- 3.32 to 3.33.

## Requirements

- **SSH Access**: SSH access to the server where Segura is installed.
- **Elevated Privileges**: permission to execute commands with elevated privileges (sudo).
- **Active License**: active license for Segura.
- **New Segura Repository**: learn [how to set up the new Segura repository](/v4/docs/installation-how-to-change-Segura-to-use-the-new-repository).

:::(error) (Application unavailable during update)
When Segura initiates the update process, all features will be unavailable until all nodes in the cluster have been fully updated.

## Update example
Assume that you are upgrading an environment that is on version 3.13 of Segura and intend to upgrade to version 3.33. To perform this upgrade, follow the steps below:

For each upgrade, you must update the Linux repositories, install `orbit-cli`, and force the upgrade to the new `orbit-cli` package using the `--force` flag.

### Versions update

```bash
sudo apt-get update #Repositories update
sudo apt-get install orbit-cli #Orbit CLI instalation
sudo orbit upgrade --force #Update the version
```

Repeat the commands above until you reach the most up-to-date version.

:::(error) (Attention!)
Itâ€™s essential that you perform the updates as shown in the **Update sequence** until you reach the most up-to-date version.
